## 🏨 Project Overview
AtliQ Grands is a premium hotel chain operating multiple five-star hotels across India. Despite being in the hospitality industry for over 20 years, the company has recently experienced a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel segment. 

This downturn has been attributed to:
- Strategic advancements by competitors
- Ineffective internal decision-making

To address these issues, AtliQ Grands aims to adopt **Business and Data Intelligence** strategies. However, due to the absence of an in-house data analytics team, their revenue management team has engaged a third-party data analyst (you) to deliver actionable insights based on historical data.

- ✅ Create key metrics based on the metric list provided
